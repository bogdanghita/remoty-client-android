Configuration tutorial

- configurations are now loaded from JSON files
- these files are under app/src/main/assets/config
- a configuration file contains the JSON serialization of a ConfigurationData object

- the configurations that will be loaded must be listed in config.json (app/src/main/assets)
- config.json is a list of ConfigurationEntry

public class ConfigurationEntry {

	String name;
	String file;
}

class ConfigurationData {

	boolean hasSteeringWheel;
	boolean hasButtons;

	List<KeysButtonInfo> buttons;
}

class KeysButtonInfo {

	String name;
	String action;

	float startXPercent;
	float startYPercent;

	float widthPercent;
	float heightPercent;
}

These classes are under app/src/main/java/com/remoty/common/datatypes

To add or modify a configuration:
- add an entry in assets/config.json with the name and file of the new configuration
- add the configuration file in assets/config

To easily generate a configuration file I have created a java project (JavaRepo/ConfigurationGenerator)
When creating a new configuration file follow these steps:
- create a new class that implements AbstractConfiguration and implement the populate() method
- see NFSMW2012.java for an example
- in main(), instantiate your new class, choose the name of the file and run the program
- it will create the specified file which you can then copy to assets/config
